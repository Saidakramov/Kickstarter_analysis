# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Analyzing the Kickstarter dataset to provide Louise with the sorted, filtered and educated information based one her requests.

### Purpose

There are two objectives of this project. First is to provide information on the campaign outcomes based on the launch dates and second one is based on the funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

According to our pivot chart and line graphs, most successful times of the year to start a campaigns are February, April, May, June, July and August. May and June has a most successful campaigns launched at 111 and 100 recpectively. Campaigns are having lower chances to success starting from October and ending with December where our line is significantly declining. The worst time of the year to launch a campaign is December with almost a fifty fifty chance to success or fail. However it is worth mentioning that almost all months of the year have a success rate between 60 and 65 percent according to our pivot table. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

According to our collected date on goals highest successful goals are between 1000 and 4999 thousand dollars and least successful goals are at 45000 to 49999 thousand dollars with 73 and 0 percent respectively. It is wroth mentioning that goals of 50000 or more have total project of over 1000 and success rate of 67 percent. However goals from 35000 to 44999 have a success rate of 67 percent, but the total amount of project are under 10 ,therefore the rates could be misleading and this goals should be avoided. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Working on this project I have encountered difficulties by picking and filtering correct values in order to create a correct pivot table and line charts on both sections. At the end I was able to play around with values and figure out the correct values on their according places. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

We can conclude that Louise should consider launching her campaign May and June where she will have a higher chances to succeed.
She needs to avoid launching on December where there is very high chance to fail.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Louise should have a goal between 1000 and 4999 as accord to our table these goals have a highest success rate.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This dataset have some extreme values and not enough date on them which could mislead our conclusions.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
As we have continuous data line graphs were the best choice, maybe we could use a bar graph as well.
